# Call for Papers: Editopia 2046\. The Future of Documentary Studies and Editing in the Postdigital

## Conference of the Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing, University of Wuppertal, September 2–4, 2026

*What comes after the digital edition?*

Digital editions have become part of everyday scholarly practice. The scholarly presentation of historical documents now takes place digitally as a matter of course—networked, openly accessible, in multiple forms of representation simultaneously. This shifts the questions we ask. We no longer debate whether digital methods are legitimate, but how we use them and to what end. Alongside technical challenges—some persisting, some newly emerging—other questions come to the fore: How does source criticism change when machines transcribe and annotate? Who funds editorial work in the long term, and who has access to its results? What aesthetic possibilities do new media open up, and what responsibility do editions bear for authenticity and trust?

A fundamental question runs through all others: When data become fluid, networked, and processual, what holds the edition together as a form? Does the concept live on, or does it dissolve?

The Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE) invites you to explore these questions together. By postdigital, we mean a constellation in which digital tools and ways of thinking are no longer understood as the opposite of the analog, but as an integral part of humanities scholarship.

We invite contributions that engage with the following topics.

**The postdigital document.** What does materiality mean in the digital realm—from file formats and storage media to infrastructures? What documentological properties do born-digital sources such as emails, websites, or social media have? How do we deal with versioning, ephemerality, and the processuality of digital artifacts? What questions do documents that combine audio, video, and interactive elements pose?

**Identity and coherence of the edition.** What constitutes an edition when its documents are fluid and networked? What role do boundaries, closure, and authority play when editions can be permanently updated? What could establish coherence under these conditions, and do we need it at all?

**Editing and artificial intelligence.** How do machine-based processes change editorial practice, from automated transcription to annotation and contextualization? Where do they expand possibilities, where do new dependencies arise? How do we deal with machine-generated uncertainty and opacity? And what does it mean when AI-generated texts themselves become objects of editing?

**Source criticism, forensics, and authentication.** How does source criticism change when documents are created digitally, migrate, and are manipulable? What methods of provenance research and authentication become necessary? How can trust in digital editions be established, and what responsibility do editors bear for transparency and traceability?

**Transmedial representation and aesthetics.** How does editing change between print, screen, and future media? What design possibilities do interactive or immersive formats open up? How does the visual and sensory dimension of digital editions influence not only their use but also scholarly understanding?

**Labor, economy, and institution.** How can edition projects be designed between project logic and long-term availability? Do editions need business models, and if so, which ones are compatible with open access and scholarly independence? How do roles and professional profiles change when editions become more collaborative, technical, and data-intensive? Under what conditions is good editorial work possible today?

**Community, accessibility, and outreach.** Who has access to digital editions and who remains excluded? What do communities like the TEI community contribute to editorial practice, and where are their limits? How can collaborative working methods and open infrastructures be designed? How can editing be taught when digital competence is assumed and documentological foundations must be taught anew?

These topics are intended as orientation. We also welcome proposals that bring new perspectives.

We invite submissions for **20-minute presentations**. **Abstracts should be 2000 to 4000 characters including spaces** and should outline a clear research question, methodological approach, and expected results. Please include a brief biographical note.

**Submission deadline: March 15, 2026**. Notification of acceptance will be sent by the end of April 2026. Publication of selected contributions is planned.
Conference languages are German and English. Participation is limited to 60 participants. No registration fee will be charged. Travel costs cannot be covered.

Please send abstracts and inquiries to [editopia2026@i-d-e.de](mailto:editopia2026@i-d-e.de).
